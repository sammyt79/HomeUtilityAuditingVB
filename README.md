# HomeUtilityAuditingVB
.NET1 week2

This was my first individual assignment for .NET I.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Design, implement, test, and debug a Visual BasicÂ® program to create a simple home utility auditing program.
 
The user should be able to do the following:
 
Enter the cost per kilowatt-hour
Select a home appliance from a list of home appliances (minimum of 6 appliances). Use the combo-box.  The six appliances must be (at a minimum):
Stereo
Dish Washer
Lava Lamp
Microwave
Gamma Blaster
TV
Enter the power needed in kilowatts (kW) for the selected appliance (average power used per hour for this device)
Enter the average number of hours used per day for the selected appliance.
 
The program should do the following:
 
Validate that the data entered has the correct format and is within a reasonable range. This means:
number of hours must be < =24
cost is appropriate (between 5 and 50 cents)
power needed for an appliance (you can use between 1 and 100)
Calculate and display the hourly cost for the selected appliance.
Calculate and display the annual cost for the selected appliance (Annual cost = hourly rate * number of hours used daily * 365)
Use a button to initiate the calculation (use a single button to perform both calculations). 
If there is an error or if not all fields have proper data then provide an appropriate message to the user 
and allow them to continue input (don't automatically clear all fields if there is an error.)
Make sure the two calculated fields cannot be edited by the user - they are for displaying the calculated values only.
Include a "Clear" button that will clear all fields.
Include an Exit button that will end the program.
 
Design a GUI for the program that will be intuitive for a novice user.
 
Write the code for the program and test the results.
 
Your name, date, project description and class must be in the code as comments (similar to an APA title page). 
This must be in the form that automatically loads when the program is executed.
 
Your project must be properly documented (describe the use of variables, describe how a function or routine works, 
use proper naming conventions for variables and labels).
